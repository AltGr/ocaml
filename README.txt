The goal of this branch is to provide backward binary compatibility between
the current version of OCaml and the binary files generated by former versions
of the compiler.

Possible problems:

- Did the format of input_value/output_value changed ? Is there a magic ?

- It is hard to mix binary files from two versions in the same executable,
   because they are not based on the same standard library. A solution ?
