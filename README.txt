Binary Compatibility
====================

The goal of this branch is to provide backward binary compatibility between
the current version of OCaml and the binary files generated by former versions
of the compiler.

Possible problems:
==================
- Did the format of input_value/output_value changed ? Is there a magic ?

- It is hard to mix binary files from two versions in the same executable,
   because they are not based on the same standard library. A solution ?

Some more remarks:
==================

 * I used to purposely put an error in a signature to force the compiler to
print the signature, and then use that signature in the interface file. It
does not work anymore, probably because error messages are better located.
But I lost something useful ! How to put it back ?

 * I would want the editor to generate automatically a map function from a
type definition, especially for big recursive ones. Maybe a tool could do
that ?
